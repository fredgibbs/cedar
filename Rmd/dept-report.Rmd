#### Data Notes
Each section has a few notes about what is and isn't counted on the plots. For more on how data was gathered from MyReports, please see the Data section at the end.

<hr>


## Headcounts
- Headcount includes students enrolled AND registered.
- Second majors and second minors are included in the overall counts of majors and minors.
- Students pursuing graduate and undergraduate certificates are counted as "majors".


<!-- ### Total Headcount -->
```{r total_headcount} 
#params$plots[["hc_level_totals_plot"]]
```


\newpage

### Undergrad Major Headcount
```{r "Undergrad Major Headcount"} 
params$plots[["hc_progs_under_long_majors_plot"]]
```

### Undergrad Minor Headcount
This shows the type of degree that students are pursuing while they earning a minor in your unit. 
```{r "Undergrad Minor Headcount"} 
params$plots[["hc_progs_under_long_minors_plot"]]
```


### Graduate Majors Headcount
```{r "Graduate Majors Headcount"} 
params$plots[["hc_progs_grad_long_majors_plot"]]
```


### Graduate Minors Headcount
```{r "Graduate Minors Headcount"} 
params$plots[["hc_progs_grad_long_minors_plot"]]
```

## Credit Hours
- Credit hours are EARNED credit hours, meaning students need to have passed the course to be included in the plots below.
- THEREFORE, the numbers here lower than what's found on the OIA dashboard, which counts credit hours based on the number of enrolled students at the census date (3rd Friday of classes).


### College Credit Hours
```{r college_credit_hours_plot} 
params$plots[["college_credit_hours_plot"]]
```


### Comparison to College
```{r college_credit_hours_comp_plot} 
params$plots[["college_credit_hours_comp_plot"]]
```


### Total Credit Hours
```{r chd_by_year_plot} 
params[["plots"]][["chd_by_year_plot"]]

```

\newpage

### Credit Hours by SUBJ + Level
```{r chd_by_year_facet_subj_plot} 
chd_by_year_table <- params$tables[["chd_by_year_table"]]
if (length((chd_by_year_table$`Subject Code`)) > 1) {
  params[["plots"]][["chd_by_year_facet_subj_plot"]]
}
```


```{r chd_by_year_subj_plot, results="asis", echo=FALSE} 
if (length(unique(params$plots[["chd_by_year_subj_plot"]]$data$`Subject Code`)) > 1) {
  cat("\n### Credit Hours by all SUBJs \n")
  params[["plots"]][["chd_by_year_subj_plot"]]
}
```

### Credit Hours from `r params$dept_code` Majors
```{r sch_dept_pct_plot} 
params[["plots"]][["sch_dept_pct_plot"]]
```

\newpage

### Credit Hours from non-Majors (last AY)
```{r sch_outside_pct_plot} 
params[["plots"]][["sch_outside_pct_plot"]]
```


### Credit Hours by Student Major (last AY)
```{r credit_hours_data_w} 
credit_hours_data_w <- params$tables[["credit_hours_data_w"]]
color.me <- which(credit_hours_data_w$Major %in% params$prog_names)

if (nrow(credit_hours_data_w) > 0) {
  kbl(credit_hours_data_w,digits=2)  %>%   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),latex_options = c("striped","HOLD_position","condensed","scale_down"), position="center", full_width=F) %>%
    row_spec(color.me, bold = T, color = "white", background = "red") %>% 
    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")
}
```

\newpage

### Credit Hours by Faculty Type
- Faculty type data is derived from an HRReport that is often slightly out of date and inconsistent. Faculty who have recently transferred or modified appointments may not be reflected in available data and therefore can distort plots using a faculty count.
- Only data from A&S is available; faculty with contracts from other Colleges show up as NA.


```{r chd_by_fac_plot.Rda} 
params$plots[["chd_by_fac_plot"]]
```


### Credit Hours by Faculty Type (+level facets)
```{r chd_by_fac_facet_plot.Rda} 
params$plots[["chd_by_fac_facet_plot"]]
```


<hr>

\newpage
## Enrollment


### Highest Total Enrollment
```{r highest_total_enrl_plot} 
params$plots[["highest_total_enrl_plot"]]
```

### Highest Average Enrollment
```{r highest_mean_enrl_plot} 
params$plots[["highest_mean_enrl_plot"]]

```

\newpage

### Historollment
```{r highest_mean_histo_plot} 
params$plots[["highest_mean_histo_plot"]]


```


\newpage

## Grades
If unit has no LD courses, all courses are used instead.

### LD DWF rates
```{r grades_summary_for_ld_plot} 
params$plots[["grades_summary_for_ld_plot"]]
```

### LD Grade Breakdown
```{r grades_summary_gened_by_course_w} 
  grades_summary_for_ld <- params$tables[["grades_summary_for_ld"]]

  kbl(grades_summary_for_ld,digits=2)  %>%   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),latex_options = c("striped","HOLD_position","condensed","scale_down"), position="center", full_width=F) %>%
    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")
```

\newpage

## Degrees

### Degrees Awarded (totals)
```{r degree_summary_filtered_program_stacked_plot} 
params$plots[["degree_summary_filtered_program_stacked_plot"]]
```


### Degrees Awarded (by major)
```{r degree_summary_faceted_by_major_plot} 
params$plots[["degree_summary_faceted_by_major_plot"]]
```

<hr>

\newpage


## Student Faculty Ratios
Students are MAJORS (incl second majors) ONLY; faculty are total FTF count for unit.


### Undergrad SFRs
```{r ug_sfr_plot} 
params$plots[["ug_sfr_plot"]]
```

### Grad SFRs
```{r grad_sfr_plot} 
params$plots[["grad_sfr_plot"]]
```


### Unit SFRs by Program
This SFR shows the breakdown by program headcounts, but since faculty don't have a formal program affiliation (as opposed to department), ratios are computed with total departmental faculty.

```{r sfr_plot_by_prog} 
params$plots[["sfr_plot_by_prog"]]
```


### SFR in College Context

```{r sfr_scatterplot } 
params$plots[["sfr_scatterplot"]]
```

## Data

### Data gathering notes
- All data comes from MyReports
  - Headcount data: "Academic Study Aggregate Guided Adhoc"
  - Course data: "Department Enrollment Status" (colloquially DESR) 
  - Degree data: "Graduates and Pending Graduates Guided Adhoc"
  - Grades data: "Class List Guided Adhoc"

MyReports data is always current (to the last business day), unlike other reports, including OIA dashboards, that use 3-week census data. Which is "better" simply depends on one's purpose. But it does mean that dashboard data is usually a bit different from other sources. How much this matters depends primarily on the course.



## Tables {.tabset}

### UG Headcount
