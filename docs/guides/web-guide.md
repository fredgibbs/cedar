# CEDAR Web Interface
The following sections correspond to the tabs on the web tool.

## Data Status
This initial view shows when data has been updated for the semesters and reports. Usually DESRs and Class Lists are most useful for real-tine enrollment reporting; the other reports are used mostly for course and department reports.

## Enrollment
Aggregated and filtered enrollment reporting. The filtering is self-explanatory. 

The most powerful control here is the `Group by` input box that selects a field to group by. 


## Course Reports
Course Reports aggregate and summarize a variety of data about a course
- enrollment across different semester types
- anomalous enrollment dips or bumps
- where students come from
- where students go
- other courses taken at the same time
- enrollment forecasts

## Seatfinder
Finds courses with available seats. This is fundamentally an enrollment report that's geared toward finding seats in Gen Ed courses. 
- The `Type Summary` tab shows different kinds of courses and how many more or fewer seats are available than the previous semester type.
- `Common`, `Previously`, and `New` tabs show relevant courses compared to the previous semester type.


Via the  the last two semester types in terms of offerings. 

## Regstats
This tool looks for anomolies in registration bumps or dimps, early drops, late drops, and waitlists to help predict future course needs. 

Anomolies are detected by looking at whether a certain phenomenon (like registration) is outside the standard deviation. It also indicates the number of students impacted by the "anomoly".

You can use threshhold filters to limit results.
