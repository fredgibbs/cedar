# CEDAR Web Interface
The following sections correspond to the tabs on the web tool.

## Data Status


## Enrollment


## Course Reports


## Seatfinder


## Regstats
This tool looks for anomolies in registration bumps or dimps, early drops, late drops, and waitlists to help predict future course needs. 

Anomolies are detected by looking at whether a certain phenomenon (like registration) is outside the standard deviation. It also indicates the number of students impacted by the "anomoly".

You can use threshhold filters to limit results.
