# Enrollment

## Web Interface
The ENROLLMENT tab on the web tool provides aggregated and filtered enrollment reporting. The filtering is mostly self-explanatory.

Special courses like thesis credits and similar are automatically filtered out. Let me know if you're not seeing a course that you need to.


The most powerful control here is the `Group by` input box, which groups aggregated output. The grouping options are fields in DESR reports, and will look familiar.

For instance, you could look at:

### Enrollments for individual sections
- Select a course (or department or whatever) without any grouping

### Total enrollment of a course by term (group by SUBJ_CRSE and TERM)
- Select a course and group by SUBJ_CRSE and TERM
- If you don't group by TERM, all terms will be aggregated together

### Enrollments of a course by instructional method (F2F versus online) by term 
- Select a course and group by INST_METHOD and TERM

### How many sections of a course different instructors are teaching 
- Select a course and group by INST_NAME

### How many 2H courses is a department offering? 
- Select a Department, and group by PT.

## Command Line

### How do I see past enrollments for a course? 
Use the course filter: `Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -c 'HIST 491'` 

### How do I see past enrollments for an entire unit for a given semester? 
Use the dept and term filters: `Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d ECON -t 202410` 

### How can I ignore the Dissertation and Independent Study sections? 
Use the "use exclude list" flag (--uel). Courses to be excluded are in the excluded_courses.R file.
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d ECON -t 202410 --uel` 

  
### What have Physics enrollments been like in recent summers? 
The term filter understands term types (fall, spring, summer):
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl  --uel -d PHYS -t summer` 


### How can I quickly see total enrollments for courses with many sections (like ENGL 1120)?
Use the `--group_cols` parameter with the name of columns (separated by columns) that you want to group
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl --uel -c 'ENGL 1120' --group_cols SUBJ_CRSE`
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl --uel -c 'ENGL 1120' --group_cols SUBJ_CRSE,TERM`


### What do 2H enrollments look like for a given term? 
Use the --pt (part of term) filter: `Rscript cedar.R -f enrl --college AS --pt 2H --uel -t 202410` 


### Why are courses listed multiple times?
Often because they are crosslisted with different values in the XL_SUBJ field. You can compress crosslisted courses into a single row by setting the -x flag to 'compress'.  

Compare:
- `Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d AFST -t 202310`
- `Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d AFST -t 202310 -x compress` 


### How can I filter out AOP enrollments? 
It almost always makes more sense to just combine the AOP and non-AOP sections in a single row, but there are two ways to handle AOP section display.

If you want to see the AOP sections stand out in an enrollment list: 
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -c 'SPAN 1110'  -t 202380 --aop compress` 

If you want the AOP sections to be totally merged into twin section: 
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -c 'SPAN 1110'  -t 202380 -x compress` 

  
### What do AOP enrollments look like for a dept? 

Use the --im filter (instructional method) for MOPS: 
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d CCS --im MOPS -t 202410` 

 

### How can I compare available courses across semesters? 
The easiest way is to use the SEATFINDER-REPORT:
- `Rscript cedar.R -f seatfinder-report -d AMST --pt 2H -t 202310,202410`
  - This saves an ugly report to CEDAR_OUTPUT_DIR/seatfinder-reports. 

For the most flexibilty, you can run two reports and manually compare: 
`- Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d AMST --pt 2H -t 202310` 
`- Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -d AMST --pt 2H -t 202410` 


### How can I get unit enrollment totals across a college? 
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl --college AS --group_cols DEPT`

 

### How can I see total waitlist numbers for courses? 
Use the ENRL function with filtering (here, for lower-division A&S courses):
`Rscript cedar.R -f enrl -t 202510 --uel --arrange waiting --college AS -l lower -a course`
