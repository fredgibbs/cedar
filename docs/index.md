# CEDAR
### Curriculum + Enrollment Data Analysis & Reporting

## What is CEDAR?
CEDAR is a suite of R scripts developed as a quick aggregation and analysis tool for MyReports data, particularly with the following reports:
- DESRs
- Class Lists
- Academic Study
- Degree


## Using CEDAR
- The friendliest way to use CEDAR is the [web interface](https://019552fb-f251-4eff-3c5d-53c55c0619d2.share.connect.posit.cloud/). 
- There are some instructions in the tool, but most are in the [web guide](web-guide). More specific instructions for enrollment reporting are on the [enrollment page](enrollment)
- Advanced users may want to consult instructions for using CEDAR on the [command line](adv-guides/terminal) or [within RStudio](adv-guides/rstudio). There is much more functionality available through these methods than the web interface at the moment.


### Data note
Data presented here MyReports data. It is not official, institutional data, which has a specific meaning for required reporting purposes, and is distinct from the data that MyReports provides. 

Institutional data reports enrollment as of the 3rd Friday of the semester (the census date). My Reports data is updated nightly, which makes it a more useful source for current semester reporting.
