# CEDAR Web Interface
The easiest way to use CEDAR is through the web interface.


## Important user tips
Usually it's fastest to start typing in your filter in the box rather than scrolling for it in the dropdown. But you have to click the term on the menu to fully select it. 

If a filter has many options, like the Instructor field, not all will be listed in the dropdown box. Just start typing in the box to zero-in on your desired term.

If you want to remove a filter, click on it, then hit the delete/backspace key.

The input boxes limit results to what you pick; if you pick nothing, it's like selecting everything; there is no filtering.

The Term box can also filter by term type, like "fall", "spring", and "summer". These are at the end of the dropdown menu or you can type one in and select it.

The following sections correspond to the tabs on the web tool.

## Data Status
This initial view shows when data has been updated for the semesters and reports. Usually DESRs and Class Lists are most useful for enrollment reporting; the other reports are used mostly for course and department reports. More details on the [data page](data).

If you need data updated, let me know! (fwgibbs@unm.edu)



## Enrollment
Aggregated and filtered enrollment reporting. The filtering is self-explanatory. 

The most powerful control here is the `Group by` input box that selects a field to group by. More details on the [enrollment page](enrollment).


## Course Reports
Course Reports aggregate and summarize a variety of data about a course, including:
- enrollment across different semester types
- anomalous enrollment dips or bumps
- student levels and classifications
- courses students come from
- courses students go to
- courses taken concurrently
- enrollment forecasts


## Seatfinder
Finds courses with available seats. This is fundamentally an enrollment report that's geared toward finding space in Gen Ed courses. 
- The `Type Summary` tab shows different kinds of courses and how many more or fewer seats are available than the previous semester type.
- `Common`, `Previously`, and `New` tabs show relevant courses compared to the previous semester type.


## Regstats
This tool looks for anomalies in registration bumps or dimps, early drops, late drops, and waitlists to help predict future course needs. 

Anomalies are detected by looking at whether a certain phenomenon (like registration) is outside the standard deviation. It also indicates the number of students impacted by the "anomaly".

More details are on the [regstats page](regstats).
