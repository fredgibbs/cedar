# CEDAR Data
CEDAR data comes from MyReports. It is not official institutional data; it reflects whatever MyReports reports as of the last date CEDAR data was updated.

Data is downloaded from MyReports in Excel files, which are ingested into CEDAR and saved as R datafiles.

## Data Status
The Data Status page of the online interface shows when different reports for different semesters have been ingested into CEDAR. This is not the date MyReports data was updated (which is daily), but the last time CEDAR data was updated with MyReports data (which is less regular for the time being).

## Updating Data
Currently (5.15.2025) this is a manual process and cannot be done via the web interface. More details coming soon.
