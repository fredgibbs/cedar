BASIC DATA UPDATES 

GENERAL RULE: When getting current data, always download ALL available fields from MyReports.

Enrollment data from DESRs and class lists are updated more or less frequently depending on the need for enrollment monitoring. 

DESR DATA (used for general enrollment reporting)
Log into MyReports
Click on the Student tab at the top
Expand the Student Reports folder
Double Click Department Enrollment Status
Wait for the Academic Period Code to not be blank
Select appropriate term and wait 5-10 seconds for the fields to refresh
Use the two double arrows to select all fields for download (everything else can be left alone)
Make sure Excel file is output format
Click Run Report
Save download (the xls file) to cedar/data/downloads/DESRs
On the command line, go to cedar/data-parsers
Rscript parse-DESR.R


CLASS LIST DATA (used for some enrollment reporting and anything that needs student data (lookout, gradebook, credit hours, forecast)
Log into MyReports

Other data needs to be updated after each semester:

In all three cases, the downloaded xls file is automatically moved from latest folder to the cedar_data_archive_dir specified in cedar/includes/config.R



DEGREE DATA
Degree data is a bit different than other reports because we can download multiple semesters in one file. You can either get the most recent semester and add it to existing data, or all semesters from Fall 209 onward at once. 

Before downloading new files, remove or archive any old files from cedar/data/downloads/degrees, so that the directory is empty.

Save to cedar/data/downloads/degrees
