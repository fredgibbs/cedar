CEDAR is a command line tool written in R.

To use it, you need to have R installed, and to able to run Rscript from the command line.

Ideally, you can clone it from GitHub, but you can also just download the zip file of the code.

CONFIGURING CEDAR

Using Finder (Mac) or the Windows File Manager, navigate to the "includes" folder in your cedar directory. You don't need to do this on the command line.

Find the cedar/includes/config_template.R, and rename it to config.R
Open the newly renamed config.R file in a text editor, like Notepad++ (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).  
DO NOT USE Notepad or Word! 

You will see lines for "cedar_base_dir" and "cedar_data_archive_dir". For each, in between the quotes: 
- cedar_base_dir: put the full path to your cedar directory. 
- cedar_data_archive_dir: put the full path to where you will store the raw Excel files from my reports after you've ingested them into CEDAR. If you don't want to archive old MyReports, leave it blank

In both cases: Make sure the path uses and ends with a regular slash "/".

Make sure filename extension stays as .R  when you save your file.

Now, on the command line, change directories to the cedar folder.

From the commannd line, type  "Rscript cedar.R" (without quotes) and press Enter
If you get an error that Rscript is not found, there is a problem with your system path.

Otherwise, you should see a long list of options and a message that no function was specified. This means EVERYTHING IS WORKING!

For fun, copy and paste the following onto the command line: 
Rscript cedar.R -f enrl-desr -c 'ENGL 1120' -t 202410 -a course

See the cookbook for examples of what you can do.
