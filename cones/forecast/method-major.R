###################### MAJOR METHOD ##########################
# Instead of just looking at course enrollments as the CONDUIT method does,
# this MAJOR method looks at how MAJORS changed from prev conduit term to conduit term 
# (the conduit term is just the term before the target term)
# Then, apply the change in majors percentage to prev_target_term enrollments
# compute how much that will contribute to target term enrollment based composition of majors in target course

# This function only handles a single course and term at a time. 
# Current logic is likely to work better for spring than fall for LD courses
