###################### CONDUIT METHOD ##########################
# For a given "target" course and term: 
# 0) Get Student IDs for students in previous (1 year ago) target course 
# 1) Identify what courses students are coming from before taking the given course. These are the "conduit" courses.
# 2) Identify how enrollments in the conduit courses changed from a year prior to target course.
# 3) Apply that pct diff to student demographics in target course

# TODO: does this count the same student multiple times in different conduit courses?
# TODO: this uses only last year's data; it should use an average of past years


# create a get_avg_enrl func in enrl.R that returns avg enrollment for set of courses and term type
# 
# use  weighted avg of conduit courses
# get enrl diff from each course to get average diff, but weight the conduit courses by contribution to target to get a composite enrollment diff
# then apply diff to total enrollment from prior year
# REQUIRES: course and term
