## What is this?
This document provides some typical data that illustrate departmental trends over time. Although a static PDF for now, eventually this will be an online dashboard to which we can add reports about enrollment, success rates, student progress, and so on. The hope is to augment the general reporting from Institutional Analytics with finer-grained data for all units. This report is modest, but represents a big step forward in systematic data gathering and reporting for the College.

## What's in here?
Please find visualizations of the following going back to Fall 2017 (except the credit hours report, because online _MyReports_ data goes back only to 2019. If anyone needs the extra couple years, I will try to get the extra data).

- Undergraduate headcount (including Majors, Pre-Majors, Second Majors, and Minors)
  - Undergraduate headcount of College
  - Term-by-term change comparison to College 
- Graduate student headcount 
- Degrees Awarded (Bachelors, Masters, PhD) + Certificates
- Student Credit Hours (lower division, upper division, graduate)
  - Student credit hours of College
  - Term-by-term change comparison to College
- Faculty / Student Ratios (undergrad and grad)

## How do I use this?
- Most plots show a dotted line that indicates semester-by-semester change. Academic Year data would be a bit smoother, but seeing the semester-by-semester variation can be useful for planning purposes.
- Most plots also show a simple best-fit line shows the general trend over the last few semesters. A linear model is not necessarily the best, but it's a good enough place to start as we ramp up our reporting capabilities.
- Labels at the end of each line show two numbers: 1) the percent change across the timeline of the plot; 2) average change per semester. 
  - The labels are based on the best-fit line, not the actual data, because semester variability in the endpoints can significantly distort the average change across the plot.
  - If a program began within the reporting period, the change is listed as infinity %, since percentage change from 0 doesn't make mathematical sense. Relatedly, percent change for very small numbers is clearly not helpful, but they appear because all units get the same plots. Apologies if they seem pointless in your situation.
- The trends lines and labels give you the big picture;  exact data is provided in a table after the plot if you want to report specific numbers.
  
- A few plots compare the Department to the College in terms of change from one semester to the text. They may show, for instance, you are consistently above or below College changes. They may be entirely useless.
- Most plots are better at provoking questions than providing answers. They might, for instance, invite inquiry about your curriculum in a semester when your enrollment was much higher compared to your unit's average, or compared to the College that term.

## Methodology
Data was gathered from UNM _MyReports_. I ran the most general report for each unit across each semester, capturing all available fields. Data was exported as an Excel file (or files). I used R for normalizing, filtering, aggregating, etc., rather than in the _MyReports_ interface. I noticed that some information can get filtered out from _MyReports_ when running a report for a specific unit, as opposed to getting all data at once. Usually these differences are very minor.


### Headcounts
#### Headcount data counts official majors, pre-majors, and second majors. It does not include minors.
<p>
The headcount plots and tables show students enrolled in a degree program of your unit AND registered for at least one credit hour during the semester. This technique, which is what OAI recommends, avoids over-reporting students who have enrolled at some point in the (possibly distant) past but are no longer active. Obviously, that number could just grow and grow over time without any correlation to the functional number of students in real life. This method will not count recently active students who are enrolled but for whatever reason are not taking credit hours. This is the standard way that _MyReports_ provides headcount data. Other data sources might report the absolute total of enrolled students (which is really an admissions statistic), but again, this would be a fairly inflated number.


### Credit Hours
MyReports has a credit hour report (Reg_Stats_Student_Credit_Hours) that lists total credit hours for each unit (based on a specific date), but the formatting of the outputted report is quite difficult to use for a general reporting tool. Instead of that, then, I have computed credit hours using the Department Enrollment Status report, which provides enrollment and total hours for each course.

For reasons I don't yet understand, the totals listed on the _MyReports_ credit hour report are much lower (and seem _really_ low) compared to when they care computed by adding up the credit hours across courses for a unit as supplied by the Department Enrollment Status data. The credit hours computed here are very similar to what is reported at OIA's dashboard (http://oia.unm.edu/facts-and-figures/official-enrollment-reports.html). 


### Summer Data
Most plots omit summer data because summer numbers are generally so much lower than the regular semesters that they distort the general trend lines. But summer data is important, so it's listed in the data tables following the plots. If you want summer data included in the plots (and the trend lines) I can regenerate a report with that data included.

## Work in Progress!
Unfortunately, some key data fields in _MyReports_ are not standardized, which can introduce minor omissions and inaccuracies when filtering and aggregating data across semesters. I have endeavored to root these out, but some oddities likely remain given the variety and diversity of the College's units and programs. I appreciate your kindness in identifying and reporting anything that doesn't look correct! I'm always happy to investigate further. 

As mentioned, data reported for both the College and units differ slightly from what's visible on the OAI'ss data dashboard, but differences are hard to account for without knowing exactly how those reports are generated. There are lots of ways to count things! However, these discrepancies do not seem to affect the general trends that are the point of this report.


## Ask for More!
If you would like additional reports or charts for your unit, or need some existing reports broken down into more detail, I will be happy to get those to you as quickly as possible. There is likely something of interest to you and/or your unit that I didn't notice in the sea of College data. I look forward to hearing about those omissions!


## Thank you
Thank you for your help and patience as we work to develop a consistent and repeatable way of generating and sharing department-level data. It definitely requires a collective effort to develop a reliable, transparent, and robust understanding of our curriculum and curriculum-delivery both for individual units and across the College. Please let me know (fwgibbs@unm.edu) if you have any questions!
